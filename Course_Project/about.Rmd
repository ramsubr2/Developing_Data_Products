## CollegescorecardApp - U.S. College Earnings and Debt Data Analysis

###  This ShinyApp visualizes College Earnings and Debt Data for 7804 U.S. Colleges based on the recently released report by U.S. Government

#### Original Data source: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

#### The data required for this analysis was extracted from the original data, median values were imputed for missing (NA) values and may have introduced some bias 

#### The project is deployed on RStudio's shiny server at: https://ramsubr2.shinyapps.io/CollegescorecardApp

#### The server.R and ui.R files can be found at: https://github.com/ramsubr2/Developing_Data_Products/tree/master/Course_Project
